    "* Adding foreign keys to complete the relationships based on the ER diagram. I also made some changes to the schemas to ensure their normalization constaint.\n",

I planned to use FlightRadar24 API at first, but then I realized they only offered it for enterprise use only. With that, I looked for substitute options and found Flightera Flight Data as a perfect substitute. Since Flightera has a limit for number of queries allowed to make under the free tier, I will only used it when needed, meaning I will pre-populate the database with some dummies data to test the features.\n",
