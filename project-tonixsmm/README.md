# CPSC 321 Semester Project

## Project Description
I am creating a web application that allows users to log their flight history and create a digital logbook of their flying history. This is a clone version of myFlightRadar24, but with a focus on the user's flight history.

## Prerequisites
* Having `node` and `npm` installed
    * Use this [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to download and install `node` and `npm`
* Having `express` installed
    * Run  `npm install express` to install
* Having a `config.json` file in the root directory with the database config information
    `
    {
        "host": HOST_NAME,
        "user": USER_NAME,
        "password": PASSWORD,
        "database": DATABASE_NAME
    }
    `

## How to run the application
* Clone this repository
* Install the prerequisites
* In the root directory, run the following command: `node [FEATURE_FILE_NAME].js`
    * For example, to run the `show_dashboard.js` file, run `node show_dashboard.js`
* Open a browser and go to `localhost:3000`
